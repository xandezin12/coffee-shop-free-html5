# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Coffee Shop website to protect user data and prevent common web vulnerabilities.

## Security Features

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing
- XSS prevention through HTML escaping
- SQL injection prevention (when backend is implemented)
- Form validation with proper error handling

### 2. Authentication Security
- Password hashing using SHA-256 with salt
- Secure session management
- Rate limiting for login attempts (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Timing-safe password comparison
- Secure password requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, special chars)

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)
```
default-src 'self';
script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://unpkg.com;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
img-src 'self' data:;
connect-src 'self' https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org;
frame-src 'none';
```

### 4. Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### 5. Data Protection
- Secure local storage with encryption
- Session timeout (24 hours)
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions
- No sensitive data in client-side storage

### 6. HTTPS Enforcement
- All external resources loaded over HTTPS
- Secure font imports from Google Fonts
- Leaflet maps loaded securely

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never store passwords in plain text**
2. **Always validate and sanitize user input**
3. **Use HTTPS in production**
4. **Keep dependencies updated**
5. **Implement proper error handling**
6. **Log security events for monitoring**

### For Deployment
1. **Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificate**
2. **Configure security headers at server level**
3. **Set up monitoring and logging**
4. **Regular security audits**
5. **Keep server software updated**

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the development team privately
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] All forms have proper validation
- [ ] HTTPS is configured
- [ ] Security headers are set
- [ ] CSP is properly configured
- [ ] No sensitive data in client code
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak information

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Security monitoring is active
- [ ] Regular security scans
- [ ] Log analysis for suspicious activity
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Incident response plan in place

## Known Limitations

### Client-side Security
- Password hashing is done client-side for demo purposes
- In production, implement server-side authentication
- Local storage is used for demo; use secure server sessions in production

### Recommendations for Production
1. Implement server-side authentication
2. Use proper database with encrypted storage
3. Set up server-side session management
4. Implement proper logging and monitoring
5. Use environment variables for configuration
6. Set up automated security scanning

## Security Updates

This security policy will be updated as new features are added or security improvements are made. Check the commit history for security-related changes.

## Compliance

This implementation follows:
- OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- Web security best practices
- Modern browser security standards
- Privacy by design principles

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns, contact the development team through the appropriate channels outlined in the main README.md file.
